### About Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks

If you're new to ESRGAN, here's an abstract straight from the paper:

The Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) is a seminal work that is capable of generating realistic textures during single image
super-resolution. However, the hallucinated details are often accompanied with unpleasant artifacts. To further enhance the visual quality, we
thoroughly study three key components of SRGAN - network architecture, adversarial loss and perceptual loss, and improve each of them to derive an
Enhanced SRGAN (ESRGAN). In particular, we introduce the Residual-in-Residual Dense Block (RRDB) without batch normalization as the basic network
building unit. Moreover, we borrow the idea from relativistic GAN to let the discriminator predict relative realness instead of the absolute value.
Finally, we improve the perceptual loss by using the features before activation, which could provide stronger supervision for brightness consistency
and texture recovery. Benefiting from these improvements, the proposed ESRGAN achieves consistently better visual quality with more realistic and
natural textures than SRGAN and won the first place in the PIRM2018-SR Challenge. The code is available
at [this https URL](https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN) .

### Model Description

We have two networks, G (Generator) and D (Discriminator).The Generator is a network for generating images. It receives a random noise z and generates
images from this noise, which is called G(z).Discriminator is a discriminant network that discriminates whether an image is real. The input is x, x is
a picture, and the output is D of x is the probability that x is a real picture, and if it's 1, it's 100% real, and if it's 0, it's not real.

```

If you want to load weights that you've trained before, run the following command.

```bash
$ python3 train.py -a esrgan16 --start-psnr-epoch 10 --resume-psnr weights/PSNR_epoch10.pth --gpu 0 [image-folder with train and val folders] 
```
